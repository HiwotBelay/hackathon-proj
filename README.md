Digital Pet Twin Challenge: 3D Pet Experience

This project is a part of the Digital Pet Twin Challenge, where we've created an interactive, 3D virtual pet experience. The pet can be a dog or a cat, with a range of interactive features that make it feel like a true companion. Users can customize their pet’s appearance, interact with it in various ways, and enjoy different environmental settings, like day/night cycles and dynamic weather.
